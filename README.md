# CodeHeaven

> A calm space to understand and improve your code | with or without AI.

**CodeHeaven** is an experimental developer tool that analyzes and explains source code.  
It will support both:
- **Local mode** – rule-based analysis written in Python  
- **AI mode** – natural-language explanations powered by a local or API-based model

This project is currently under active development.  
New features and updates are being added step-by-step as part of a learning journey.

Stay tuned 🧑‍💻
